### This control file can be used to generate a .deb package that
### Provides various icon themes, so you won't be forced to install
### them, as some programs unnecessarily depend on them. However,
### you will still be able to install the ones you choose manually.
### To create the package, run `equivs-build icon-themes-equiv` from
### the same directory as this file. You can then install it by running
### `dpkg -i icon-themes-equiv_1.0_all.deb` as root.
